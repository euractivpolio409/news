  <p>Ahead of the European Parliament's AGRI Committee meeting, Portugal's agriculture minister outlined the country's priorities and expressed confidence that Member States are moving towards a common position.</p>
  <p>The minister said a coalition between Spain, Germany and Portugal has already secured "a good deal", likely to be backed by the majority of Member States. According to Fernandes, their priorities include stronger environmental protections and support for small and vulnerable farmers.</p>
  <p>"We are focused on protecting the environment, to make our regions and countries more resilient," he said. "The concept of vulnerable farmers is very important for us. Women, young farmers, old farmers, and others who need stronger support."</p>
  <p>When asked about the possibility of an agreement during the trilogues, the minister he had not been following the parliamentary debate closely, but recognised that some political groups appeared to echo some positions similar to those heard in the Council.</p>
